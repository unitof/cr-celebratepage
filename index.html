    <h2>A brief note</h2>
    <p>Just over a year ago, we were not sure if we could keep our storefront home. We rethought our <a href="https://cityreliquary.org/join">membership program</a>, <a href="https://www.cityreliquary.org/plan-your-visit/">gradually reopened</a> the museum to the public, and ran a few <a href="https://www.bkmag.com/2021/01/29/pandemics-make-strange-bedfellows-too/">experimental events</a> in our backyard. Now, we’re celebrating the final days of our busiest, strangest, most wonderful year yet. Thank you, dearly, for being part of it.</p>
    <p>Amid new public health protocols, we pivoted to a new model that emphasized collaboration with local artists and performers—NYC creatives that include burlesque dancers, stand-up comedians, performance artists, musicians, filmmakers, and authors. This shift has allowed us to continue presenting ambitious exhibits and events that, in true Reliquary tradition, emphasize the overlooked people, places, and moments in local history.</p>
    <p>With your help, here’s what we were able to achieve:</p>
